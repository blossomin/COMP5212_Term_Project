# Machine Learning for plant pathology: diagnosing foliar diseases of apple trees

One of the most significant temperate fruit crops in the world is the apple. Apple orchard quality and overall output are seriously threatened by foliar diseases. The current method of disease diagnosis in apple orchards relies on time-consuming, expensive manual scouting by humans.

Despite the potential of computer vision-based models for identifying plant diseases, there are several issues that need to be resolved. Large variations in a single illness's visual symptoms between apple cultivars or new types that emerged during cultivation present significant difficulties for computer vision-based disease identification. These variances result from changes in the natural and image-capturing contexts, such as the age of diseased tissues, the non-uniform picture background, and varied light illumination during imaging, among other factors, such as leaf color and morphology.

We got a training dataset of apple foliar disease including a sizable expert-annotated illness dataset and around 23,000 high-quality RGB photos of apple foliar diseases. We hope to develop a machine learning model based on the dataset to conquer the challenge mentioned above.
